This repository contains the source code for the project in the course "Advanced Information Retrieval WS 2022".
The main topic was the implementation of two re-rankers and their comparison.

On the website, agree to the terms and conditions, then the download links become visible, then download the collection from the Document Retrieval section.
Finally, extract the dataset to a folder "dataset".
